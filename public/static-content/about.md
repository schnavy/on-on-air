**On. on Air** is a open Index for
_new/ independent/ experimental/ punk/ niche/ nerdy/ experimental/ contemporary_ web radios.

It emerged from a private archive of web radios that I've been listening to. Even though there is not limitation by radio transmitted signals, many of these radios are mostly known in their local surrounding, listened to by peers and friends.
I was hoping to grow an independent public archive, that concentrates on the niches.
So feel free to add your favorite web radio to the list, or edit the existing ones, if you feel something is missing.

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:mail@davidwahrenburg.de">Mail</a>.
The source code is available
on <a href="https://www.github.com/schnavy/on-on-air" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Planned/Possible Features:

- Option to submit changes to existing entries
- history of changes like a wiki?
- Add a rating system
- Embed live streams
- Indicate current live radios
