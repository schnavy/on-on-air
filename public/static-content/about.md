**On. on Air** is a open Index for _new/independent/experimental/punk/niche/nerdy/experimental/contemporary_ web radios.

It emerged from a private collection of web radios that I've been listening to.
Platform independent radio stations, that explore live audio streams and curate new programs should get more attention.
There is no plan in what way it will be curated, wether it is an unfiltered index with a curated selection, a rating
system or whatever.
So feel free to add your favorite web radio to the list, or edit the existing ones, if you feel something is missing.

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to contact me. The source code is available
