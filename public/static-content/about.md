**On. on Air** is a open Index for
_new/ independent/ experimental/ punk/ niche/ nerdy/ experimental/ contemporary_ web radios.

It emerged from a private archive of web radios that I've been listening to. Even though being openly available thought the internet, many of these radios are mostly known in their local surrounding, listened to by peers and friends.
I was hoping to grow an independent public archive, of such radio stations, focusing on the niches.
Feel free to add your favorite web radio to the list, or edit the existing ones, if you feel something is missing. (WIP)
